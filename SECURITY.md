## üîç Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security

**Input Handling**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Proper input validation
const sanitizeInput = (input: string): string => {
  return DOMPurify.sanitize(input.trim());
};

// ‚ùå Bad: Direct HTML insertion
element.innerHTML = userInput; // Vulnerable to XSS
```

**API Integration**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Secure API calling
const callAPI = async (endpoint: string, data: unknown) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(endpoint, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${getSecureToken()}`
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(sanitizeData(data))
    });
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle without exposing sensitive info
    console.error('API call failed');
    throw new Error('Request failed');
  }
};
```

**Environment Variables**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Secure environment variable usage
const API_KEY = process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY;
if (!API_KEY) {
  throw new Error('API key not configured');
}

// ‚ùå Bad: Exposing keys in client code
const API_KEY = 'hardcoded-key-here'; // Never do this
```

### Component Security

**Secure Props Handling**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Validated props
interface SecureBeatCardProps {
  beat: Beat; // Validated type
  onSelect: (id: number) => void; // Type-safe callback
}

const BeatCard: React.FC<SecureBeatCardProps> = ({ beat, onSelect }) => {
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    if (beat?.id && typeof beat.id === 'number') {
      onSelect(beat.id);
    }
  }, [beat.id, onSelect]);
  
  return (
    <div onClick={handleClick}>
      {/* Escaped content */}
      <h3>{escapeHtml(beat.title)}</h3>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## üö´ Common Vulnerabilities to Avoid

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Never** use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization
- **Always** escape user-generated content
- **Use** Content Security Policy headers

### Injection Attacks
- **Sanitize** all database queries
- **Use** parameterized queries
- **Validate** API inputs
- **Escape** special characters

### Authentication Issues

- **Implement** proper session management
- **Use** secure, httpOnly cookies when possible
- **Validate** authentication on every request

### Information Disclosure
