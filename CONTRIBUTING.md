### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names following this pattern:
- `feature/add-beat-upload`
- `fix/audio-player-bug`
- `docs/api-documentation`
- `refactor/component-structure`
- `test/collaboration-hub`

### Commit Message Guidelines

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```bash
<type>(<scope>): <description>

# Examples:
feat(beats): add advanced filtering options
fix(player): resolve audio playback issues
docs(readme): update installation instructions
style(ui): improve responsive design for mobile
refactor(api): simplify user authentication flow
test(components): add unit tests for BeatCard
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

- [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas
- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation
- [ ] My changes generate no new warnings
```

### Review Process

1. **Automated checks** must pass (CI/CD pipeline)
2. **Code review** by maintainers
3. **Manual testing** of new features
4. **Approval** by at least one maintainer
5. **Merge** into main branch

## üíª Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- **Use TypeScript** for all new code
- **Define interfaces** for all data structures
- **Enable strict mode** and address all type errors
- **Use meaningful type names** and avoid `any`

```typescript
// Good
interface BeatMetadata {
  bpm: number;
  key: Key;
  mood: Mood;
  duration: number;
}

// Avoid
const data: any = {};
```

### React Components

- **Use functional components** with hooks
- **Implement proper error boundaries**
- **Use React.memo** for performance optimization
- **Follow component composition patterns**

```typescript
// Good
const BeatCard: React.FC<BeatCardProps> = React.memo(({ beat, onSelect }) => {
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    onSelect(beat);
  }, [beat, onSelect]);

  return (
    <div onClick={handleClick}>
      {/* Component content */}
    </div>
  );
});

BeatCard.displayName = 'BeatCard';
```

### CSS & Styling

- **Use Tailwind CSS** utility classes
- **Maintain responsive design** principles
- **Follow accessibility** guidelines
- **Use consistent spacing** and color schemes

```typescript
// Good
<div className="bg-gray-800 rounded-lg p-6 shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow">
  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">{title}</h3>
</div>
```

### API Design

- **Use RESTful conventions**
- **Implement proper error handling**
- **Include request validation**
- **Document all endpoints**

```typescript
// Good
router.get('/api/beats', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { page, limit, mood } = req.query;
    const beats = await beatService.getBeats({ page, limit, mood });
    res.json({ success: true, data: beats });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ 
      success: false, 
      error: 'Failed to fetch beats' 
    });
  }
});
```

### File Organization

```
components/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/                 # Reusable UI components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Button.tsx
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Modal.tsx
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts       # Barrel exports
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/          # Feature-specific components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BeatExchange/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CollaborationHub/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ layout/            # Layout components
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Header.tsx
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Footer.tsx
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and functions
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Test complete user workflows
- **API Tests**: Test backend endpoints

### Writing Tests

```typescript
// Component test example
describe('BeatCard', () => {
  it('should render beat information correctly', () => {
    const mockBeat = {
      id: 1,
      title: 'Test Beat',
      producer: 'Test Producer',
      bpm: 120
    };

    render(<BeatCard beat={mockBeat} onSelect={jest.fn()} />);
    
    expect(screen.getByText('Test Beat')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('Test Producer')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('120 BPM')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## üìö Documentation

### Code Documentation

- **Comment complex logic** and algorithms
- **Document public APIs** with JSDoc
- **Include usage examples** in component docs
- **Keep README updated** with new features

```typescript
/**
 * Filters beats based on provided criteria
 * @param beats - Array of beats to filter
 * @param filters - Filter criteria (mood, bpm, key)
 * @returns Filtered array of beats
 * @example
 * const filtered = filterBeats(beats, { mood: Mood.Hype, bpm: 120 });
 */
export function filterBeats(beats: Beat[], filters: BeatFilters): Beat[] {
  // Implementation
}
```
